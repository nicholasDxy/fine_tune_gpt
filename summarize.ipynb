In \"What Befell Candide among the Bulgarians\", \\'our hero\\' must \\'run the gauntlet six and thirty times through the whole regiment, or to have his brains blown out with a dozen musket-balls\\'. Two years later, as Prom Committee President, such a dilemma hit close home. But who was playing this cruel satire on my life? Any path I attempted seemed near-fatal. Many were disillusioned about this \"First Ever Prom\", few were dedicated or willing to help, and people bluntly said it could not be done.After all, though, we lived in suffocating Saudi Arabia, where a heavily publicized COED gathering, moreover, a dance, would be impossible. So was my call to empowerment. I became Prom for six months. I inhaled menu plans, and exhaled decoration themes. I spoke royalty items, and heard ticket sales. Never before had I ever felt a task so personal, so symbiotic, so me. May 30th, 2002, \"Midsummer Night\\'s Dream\" was ready: the lamps twinkled, the tiered fountain sparkled, and the enchanted garden exuded life. It was the most ecstatic and gratifying night of my life...As I ushered my classmates out, one of my senior friends, with tears in her eyes, begged me to extend the Prom just another half hour. All these sleepless nights, this hardship, this aggravation, seemed somehow to be worth it. For one whole night, I felt fulfilled, achieved, accomplished...

I won\\'t even go see my friends on Friday. Yeah, I promise. Sure, of course I think about you...I think about you all the ti-what!?! Now you think I\\'m cheating on you? Listen, don\\'t make this any bigger than it already is. I said I got some important stuff to do, and I\\'ll see you later!I just had a talk with her. Didn\\'t go too well...Well what more does she want from me? Three hours a night isn\\'t good enough? But wait! Allow me to clarify things! This is not some petty teenage love quarrel, but a gruesome, drawn out war I have engaged in for much of my life. The \"significant other\" I argued with above is not a girlfriend, but uniquely, a void filled in my life by....a BED: that\\'s right! A bed! I\\'m unfaithful to sleep! I cheat on sleep like an adulterous husband, like a tango dancer that has had one too many partners! I \"sleep around\": just about anywhere- in the car, on the lunch table, in history class-I\\'m high on life while simultaneously, nearly every individual component within my environment has a near sleep-inducing effect on me. But I realize now by the near end of my high school term, I wouldn\\'t have wanted it any other way.\"Are you O.K. honey? Lately, you\\'ve seemed a little hara-kiriish-well, I mean, you\\'re way up there with your potential...you do have a lot on your plate.\" Many concerned teachers have approached me with this same, almost robotically preset inquiry. My Algebra II/Trig. teacher, apparently with a bachelor\\'s in psychology, called me in once for a one-on-one. From his line of questioning, it was obvious he was looking for the tell-tale signs of suicide...No, I\\'m not suicidal! I have a wonderfully loving family, great friends, a great school: life is grand! I\\'m involved in so many things because that\\'s the only way I like it. While it may be somewhat painful the night of, the next morning, I\\'m amazed at having finished my math homework, written an English essay, and memorized all my lines for the play. What I do not like, though, is the word potential...\"Calm down man, you\\'re way ahead of your potential\" someone once said. A potential attempts to impose a calculated box around one\\'s achievements, limiting their possible accomplishments. If I am convinced my potential is an \\'8\\', my every effort from then on will be to achieve a \\'9\\'. Potential is an individual\\'s promise to one\\'s self: one of excellence-to strive to achieve, to succeed everyday, to encapsulate yourself within a shell by morning and break through it by night. Only a quitter has a fixed potential.I must say now, this whole \\'cheating-on-sleep\\' idea is somewhat exaggerated and meant for comical effect. Surely, I am not an insomniac, nor am I narcoleptic, and I don\\'t intend on changing in college and making up for this \\'lost\\' nap-time. But all I know for sure is this: if commitment to excellence comes at the expense of \\'cheating-on-sleep\\', file me for adultery, \\'cuz I\\'m not changing!',\n",

My parents said Yanni was a piano virtuoso, for whatever that was worth to a nine year older. As I awaited in \\'enthusiastic anticipation\\', our virtuoso finally came out-neatly tamed afro, \\'pizzeria man\\' moustache, and white tuxedo-assuming the piano in a decrescendo of the uproarious applause marking his antecedent arrival. \"Good music\" my uncle critiqued; I agreed, nodding my head vigorously as I examined the interwoven fibers of my couch seat. It was good music though, and the aggressive verve of the second piece compelled me to look up-there was Yanni, but what had happened to him? He slammed on the keys, cocked his head back slowly, closed his eyes, smiled, jolted his head forward creasing his eyebrows angrily, and repeated this cycle with a variation of facial disfigurations. Did he have Parkinson\\'s or was he simply suffering a temporary spasm attack? The very thought of this caused me to laugh boorishly; I attempted to explain my apparently unappreciated conduct between my cackles. Disappointed, my mother frowned at me saying, \"It\\'s because he feels with the music\". Never would a comment affect me as this one did.Eight years later, I am a near veteran of my high school wind ensemble. I am an alto saxophonist. I am a musician. I am obsessed with music. I hear it in my thoughts, during exams, and in my attempts to sleep. When I am far from my saxophone, I position fingerings in the air and simulate the anticipated notes in my mind. I sing harmonies in my head, and conduct the orchestra that inhabits my being in front of the mirror with a baton. When I play a piece with an ensemble, it possesses me- I am an acquiescing host. For a day, I am Mussorgsky\\'s \"Pictures at an Exhibition\", I become Holst\\'s \"First Suite\". I am propelled into a state of hypnotic ecstasy. I speak in key signatures and dynamics, and think in articulation and movements. The passion that I have for music, the discipline and humility it has taught me, the appreciation for purpose and cooperation it has granted me, and the resilience it has empowered me with are irreplaceable.How fortunate I am to be given the opportunity to allow music satiate my soul and tantalize my senses. Finally, I understand the piano virtuoso Yanni that the callow me mocked. Finally, I am able to begin to perceive the grand implications of his awesome gift. Finally, I am able to feel music, and no greater is there such a rapture.',\n",

       "  'content': 'From Negative to Positive (Or Positive to Negative?) The lurid confessions of a member of Teeny-Bopper AnonymousWow. Wasn\\'t I cool? Since this picture was taken, everything outside of myself - my appearance, my surroundings, even my superficial attitudes about life - has undergone a complete revolution. Contrasting me with that girl in the picture would be like comparing this picture with its negative; everything in this picture is now reversed, inside out.Life started out fairly easy. Before middle school, I did what I wanted to do without regrets. If my friends wanted to do the same, company would be nice; if not, I would have just as much fun alone. Middle school changed things. Suddenly group dynamics became almost political, and social esteem, not self-esteem, became the key to happiness. Seventh grade, the time when this picture was taken, was the peak of social pressure in my life.This picture epitomizes all of the elements that society had labelled as \"important\" for my peers and me, yet it also belies them through subtle clues.For example, while I exude quite smugly what I think is maturity, the menagerie of stuffed animals and the \"cutesy\" picture of kittens are reminders of my immaturity.The picture also reveals the things about myself that I\\'d thought were hidden away; my veneer of anti-intellectualism is belied by the often-used bookshelf and world map behind me. If I truly believed what I preached, my bookshelf would be tidy from disuse and pictures of some cretin teeny-bopper would adorn my wall.Why do social pressures transform otherwise intelligent, creative children into lemmings? These influences to conform transcend the mere pressure of peers; they come from society as a whole. The media portray \"teens\" with a uniform image that tells them the way they \"should\" be.A young consumer of modern entertainment (TV, movies, recent books) comes to think of the most prevalent image of \"teens\" as the norm.The roles of young women in American culture are even narrower, as delineated by the following three tenets:1. You must be trendy. Following current styles and fads is mandatory.Additionally, the timeless rules still apply: make-up must be worn and legs must be shaven. (A careful observer might note that I am wearing blue (!) eye-shadow and blush and sport a few trendy styles: a hat, curled hair, and a T-shirt replete with pithy sayings.)2. You must keep abreast of current events, not in the world abroad, but in your own parochial world. If you do not know in advance what everyone is wearing on Friday night or who is talking with whom, you are doomed to live alone eternally with only 13 cats for companionship.3. Adults aren\\'t cool. Always scowl in their presence. I was so convinced that I was living the ideal \"teen\" life that I had no time to think about things of true importance. Although I did homework, and did it well, I looked at school assignments as another chore to be done; I may as well tell them what they want to hear and get it over with, instead of actually thinking.Thus, any intellectual activity that I engaged in did not permeate my consciousness. My journal from seventh grade is a continuous recitation of rumors, speculation, and other excerpts from the rather dull soap opera of seventh grade social life: proof that nothing besides this rather large mass of intellectual Spam squooshed around in my trendy blonde head for very long.But then things changed: the advent of New Kids on the Block in eighth grade cleared this banality from my life. New Kids on the Block was an untalented group of kids assembled by a music producer for the express purpose of making money. Not only did I dare to be the only girl in my grade who didn\\'t like them, I dared to despise them. I listened to my music and figured that matters of taste really shouldn\\'t matter to my friends.Wrong! Not only was I isolated from the stimulating debates about which one was cutest, but the giggles I unsuccessfully attempted to stifle certainly didn\\'t add to my popularity. At the time, this isolation upset me greatly, but not enough to make me conform. The social vacuum in my life was replaced by ideas: books, newspapers, schoolwork, and in-class debates on subjects ranging from legalizing drugs to literature.I summarized my feelings in my journal on November 29, 1989 when I wrote, \"Let them laugh! I\\'d rather be an original nerd than a conformist follower.\"So it was that a little less than a year after this picture was taken, its negative became closer to the truth; prominent lemming-like qualities faded into the shadows while hints of originality and intellect, previously buried in darkness, became illuminated.',\n",
       "  'summary': \"I used to think I was cool, but now I see things differently. When I look at a picture of myself from seventh grade, it's like looking at a reversed negative. In middle school, social pressures made me focus on what others thought of me, rather than being myself. The picture shows the things society said were important, but also hints at my true self. The pressure to conform comes from everywhere - peers and the media. Society expects teens, especially girls, to be trendy and up-to-date on gossip. Adults aren't cool and thinking deeply is not valued. But when I started to stand up against the crowd, my life changed. I let go of caring about being popular and embraced my own interests. I found joy in books, debates, and learning. I realized it's better to be true to who I am, even if it means being labeled a nerd.\"},\n",

       "  'content': 'The smell of twenty-seven kinds of chili and one style of barbecue wafted through the air at the Palo Alto Chili Festival. It was a perfect day on a summer weekend, one of many I had spent volunteering for the Palo Alto Fire Explorers. The morning was quiet as usual - a few Band-Aid cases and requests for sunscreen. Sprawled on an assembled cot under the shade of the booth, I was thinking of getting myself lunch when my radio started squawking: \"Unknown medical emergency, respond Code 3 to field.\" I grabbed my trauma bag and jogged out of the booth. \"10-4,\" I said. \"I\\'m en-route.\"As I ran down the gravel path, the pounding of my feet matched the beating of my heart. Medical terms and images from my Red Cross textbook floated through my mind. Memories also hovered - the simulated emergency scenarios I passed, my top score on the final examinations, the moment I was \"knighted\" with trauma shears by Tony Graham, chief advisor to the Palo Alto Fire Explorers. The recollections reassured me, but they could only partly bridge the chasm between uncertainty and confidence - for the rest of the distance, I would have to trust myself and jump.I burst through a hedge of bushes and onto wet grass. A young boy was kneeling, doubled over in the center of a crowd. He was crying. As I bent to examine him, Tony Graham and another emergency team member arrived on bikes. Tony began questioning the boy\\'s relatives. Apparently, Bryan had injured himself while playing some sport. I inspected my patient. \"Okay, his clavicle is broken,\" I said, turning to my teammate. \"Can you grab me the splint?\" When we finished immobilizing the boy\\'s injury, the paramedics had arrived. As the boy was lifted onto the stretcher and carried to the ambulance, I waved goodbye. \"Don\\'t worry, Bryan, you\\'ll be fine,\" I called after him, smiling. He looked at me uncertainly at first, but as he was carried away his face changed. He stopped crying, and though his face remained clenched with pain, I distinctly saw his lips curve up and form a brief smile.Bryan was one patient that inspired me to stay three years with the Palo Alto Fire Explorers, which provided quality emergency response at cultural festivals and athletic competitions across the Bay Area. After undergoing a two-year training program that covered first aid to fire science, I was offered a spot on the leadership council, on which I took on the responsibility of educating second-year Explorers. Although I scheduled paramedics to give biweekly lectures, my favorite memories from the Explorers came from times when I was teaching myself. I remember one such class, Patient Care and Bedside Manner, which I concluded with the following words: in every interaction, think about what you have done for the patient, but, more importantly, what the patient has done for you - what have you gained from the encounter? The answer goes beyond simple medicine.',\n",

This experience, along with others during my three years with the Fire Explorers, inspired me to continue my work and eventually become part of the leadership council. I learned that patient care goes beyond medicine and can also have a positive impact on me.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'On a summer vacation with my family last year, my first experience of independence in Italy was of almost being arrested. My parents had decided that they wanted to go to Europe for our annual summer trip. Since I had studied Latin for three years, I told them that I wanted to go to Rome. They agreed, and we packed our bags for a trip to Italy. The only problem was that once we got to Rome, two of those bags were missing. We found one, but the other was nowhere to be seen. While my parents were talking to an official at the desk, who happened to know English, I was sent off into the separate baggage claim room to see if our missing bag had arrived yet. On the way back to meet my parents, I was stopped by a policeman who had a very large dog and a gun. He asked to see my passport, which my parents were carrying. I tried to explain this fact, but he didn\\'t seem to understand. He then asked, in English, \"Are you a hash dealer?\" It was a surprising question, but I calmly responded, \"No.\" \"So you just smoke hash sometimes,\" was his response. Beginning to get disturbed, I responded again, \"No.\" His third question was more of a statement, \"So you just smoke cigarettes.\" Not being a smoker, I again responded, \"No.\" He went back to the first question. He tried to get me to go into the room that I\\'m guessing was some sort of interrogation room, but I managed to get him to come over to my parents. He asked, \"Is this your baby,\" seeming unaware of the fact that I was sixteen and had just managed to keep cool in front of a man carrying a large gun and whose dog\\'s size implied that it was part German shepherd and part horse. Thankfully, my parents responded, \"Yes,\" and showed the guard our passports. Seeming not the least bit apologetic and perhaps a bit disappointed at not arresting a new felon, the officer said, \"Bene,\" and walked away. So began my trip to the cradle of civilization.So much of that trip passed in a hurry. The Coliseum, the Roman Forum, and the great fortress of the Vatican all passed by in such a short time. I had really wanted to see the ruins of the civilization that I have learned about in my Latin class, and this trip gave me the chance. Only about fifteen miles from Rome sits Ostia Antica, an ancient city that is much like the Roman Forum except about a hundred times larger and devoid of people. I saw Pompeii, a city I had studied for a full year in a textbook filled with cartoons. Mt. Vesuvius on the horizon behind the city looked just like the pictures in my book. I recognized the things I had studied, and had a chance to see firsthand what had largely been in my imagination.It was the freedom I had that set this trip apart. I have been on many trips outside of the United States with my parents and three to Europe before this one. They had never let me wander off in foreign cities before. I found it exhilarating to roam through the streets of Rome near our apartment at night, and to explore the foreign villages we stayed at in the countryside. In some of the places we visited, my parents gave me the camera and let me stray off for a while, taking pictures they wouldn\\'t have, such as one of an ancient Roman mosaic in Pompeii of the birth of Venus, or a panorama of Rome. I did spend most of my time with my parents, but the freedom was something new.Our last four days were spent in Paris. The last night was July thirteenth, the night before Bastille Day, and the night when the entire city of Paris turns into one large party, called the Bal. While my parents slept in our hotel on the Ile St. Louis, near the center of the city, I walked a few kilometers to the Tullieries gardens and around the winding streets of the city. I went to the banks of the Seine, where masses of people were dancing and listening to music played over huge speakers. On the way I watched dancers and drummers on a bridge and visited another bridge that had been converted into a food court and a stage for live music. I spent my last hours in Paris among people whose language I didn\\'t know, awed by the revelry that lasted deep into the night.The next day we left for home. I had loved our trip instead of counting the days until it ended, as I had when I was younger. That was due to my visiting places I had dreamed of seeing, and my newfound freedom. Next year chances are I will live in a city far from my home in Oakland, California, and my family. I know now that I\\'ll be ready to learn from that place and my new situation, and to have fun on my own. All of these events, from the accusing guard at the Rome airport to my walk through Paris at night, have shown me that I can adapt to new situations on my own, and appreciate them for myself.',\n",

       "  'content': \"The advent of the year 2000 signifies a new world of hope and challenges for our country and the planet. With developments in technology such as the Internet, the world is coming closer together than ever. It is vital for the survival of our planet that we become more tolerant and understanding of other cultures so that we can work together for the benefit of future generations. During the past century, two World Wars and countless smaller struggles have decimated nearly every part of the planet. Today, too many countries and specific ethnic groups are involved in conflicts across the globe which are causing incredible violence and death. This makes it imperative that we teach the values of tolerance, diversity, and cooperation to our children.Unfortunately, many people (especially teenagers) are very apathetic when it comes to global issues. When most people my age watch the evening news, they often feel very removed from the international situations and issues that are presented. The drug war in Colombia, Indonesian political crisis and solar eclipse in Rumania hold no personal significance or even interest for most teenagers. For me, however, these events are more than just images on a television screen. Through an organization called Children's International Summer Villages (CISV), I have developed close friendships with people from all of these countries and many more. CISV is a non-profit, international, educational organization that operates in over eighty nations. Its purpose is to foster cross-cultural friendship and understanding for people of all ages.When I was eleven years old, I traveled with a delegation of three other children and an adult leader to Munich, Germany, to participate in what is known as a Village. Living with other children from twelve different countries for a month was an experience that completely changed my view of life. I gained a different perspective on what it means to be a member of a world community and formed extremely close friendships with many people who did not speak English.I continued participating in local CISV activities and have attended three National Board Meetings for the organization in Cincinnati. When I was thirteen I traveled to a camp in Washington, D.C. I went to Detroit as a counselor for eleven-year-olds when I was sixteen, and this past summer I flew to Finland for three weeks to be part of a Seminar Camp. Created for seventeen- to nineteen-year-olds from twenty different nations, this event was the best experience I've had. At the beginning of the Seminar Camp, the participants had to decide as a group what we wanted to get out of our time together and what sort of focus the camp should have. As a participant, I was involved in planning each day's activities, which ranged from serious discussions of current events to intricate role-playing games and trips around Helsinki. Problems were discussed and solved in 'open meetings', which were similar to the Quaker Meetings for Business at my school. The skills of compromise, creative problem-solving and respect I have learned throughout my years at a Quaker institution were very useful to me.Despite the different cultures and perspectives each person brought to the group, what we discovered as a result of our time together was that we were all fundamentally very similar. If these skills and experiences could be passed on to the global leaders of tomorrow, I believe that we would have more peaceful and successful resolutions to world conflicts.One simulation we created had the delegates pretending to be refugees waiting to pass through immigration. As with every activity at our Seminar Camp, this simulation was followed by an in-depth discussion during which we each shared our individual experiences and perspectives on the subject. I was amazed to learn just how powerful my United States passport really was. Several people had experienced discrimination and mistreatment while trying to obtain visas or participate in CISV camps. One friend from Brazil had been held in a foreign airport for two days solely because of his nationality, and another had been detained because of his 'suspicious' appearance. One delegate from Lebanon told of being kidnapped during that country's civil war. The realization of how much easier my life is because I was lucky enough to be born in America really hit me. I believe that the democratic values and human rights we enjoy in this country should be fundamental to every nation.At the end of July, I returned home with more than just photographs and Finnish souvenirs. In a remarkably short amount of time, I had become more independent, self-sufficient, and knowledgeable about the world and its inhabitants. My international experiences with CISV, through which I have learned skills of cooperation, trust, and tolerance, have truly given me global perspective. Hopefully, I will be able to further these talents at college and use them in the future to enable others to achieve the sense of world community that I have found. I am committed to making the CISV experience available to as many people as possible in every country. Because of CISV, I was inspired to take a strong interest in foreign languages, so that I would be better able to communicate with my international friends. Currently, I am learning French, Spanish and Welsh, and hope to branch out further in college. This is very important to me, because I believe that understanding our similarities and differences is the only way in which the human race will survive and prosper in the coming millennium.\",\n",

       "  'content': 'The doorbell rang incessantly. The rest of the NASA Sharpies (as we like to call ourselves) and I in the room looked at each other in confusion - the door was already wide open. Glancing over, we saw Kennedy walk in with a curious look on his face. \"Why does it make that sound when I press that?\" he asked us. We all responded by letting out a heartfelt chuckle. I explained to him that pressing that little button is usually used to signal to the residents living inside that there is a visitor waiting to be greeted. \"Ah, that\\'s tight!\" he replied while smiling. He had never seen such a device in his hometown of Tafuna, American Samoa. Although it may have seemed to be just a trivial difference in the two cultures, it was one of many moments at NASA SHARP that allowed me to experience firsthand the richness of diversity.Twenty of us flew into LAX, everyone from a different part of the United States or one of its outlying territories. The first night, we played a game where each of us was asked questions ranging from favorite sports teams to professional goals. I participated intently in the game, asking as many questions as I could to learn more about everyone. It became quite clear that although there were differences in our backgrounds and ethnicities, we had many interests in common. I began to realize that the disparities between us were not barriers but catalysts for meaningful interaction.I learned something different from each sharpie. Fozoh taught me how to solve a Rubik\\'s cube. Tiffany lent me some CDs that they listened to down in Mobile (properly pronounced \"Mobeeeele\"), Alabama. Andrea described life on a Navajo reservation and debunked many myths that I had. Kennedy told stories of how he could string thirty coconuts together back in Samoa. Jasmine even allowed me to try one of her special Puerto Rican fruits. I, personally, cooked authentic Chinese fried rice for the others and explained many times that we say \"pop\" instead of \"soda\" in the Midwest.Together, we would often stay up at late at night. Over chips and salsa, we discussed issues that we felt were pertinent. My views often clashed with others\\' as we debated topics ranging from politics to movies. It was lighthearted and fun at the time, but now I look back with a sense of nostalgia. The environment that existed at NASA SHARP broadened my point of view and made me reevaluate my stance on certain issues. The beauty of our differences is that it allows us to have such different perspectives and intellectually stimulate others.Over the eight weeks, I developed a deep respect for the eclectic community that surrounded me. Coming from a homogenous suburb in the Midwest, I was in awe as we bonded. It is this desire to connect that I hope to bring to Yale - perhaps not by cooking fried rice for everyone, but by having an open mind and an avid determination to embrace the power of diversity.',\n",

       "  'content': 'Midnight was two hours old before I could finally peel out of my costume. The prosthetic nose and glue-on beard tore at my skin as I tugged them off, and they quickly joined the clutter on the bathroom floor: a tired pile of mismatched robes, rags, and a decrepit old wig. I stood in my boxers and scrubbed at the layers of pasty make-up until forty years were washed down the sink, until finally a look in the mirror revealed my own face, clean and raw. It was the first time in the last six hours that I had confronted a reflection that told the truth. My own face.The disjointed memory of a vibrant evening began to tickle my mind, whizzing around my brain like an insect trapped in a jar. Everything that evening had felt somehow monumental. A sea of people, and a white blaze that consumed my vision as I stood on that enormous stage. There was the elaborate music cue; the song performed in the violent shine of a spotlight; the applause that seemed almost too thick; and finally the award, handed to me by that black-bedecked woman. I remembered the podium and the clutter of notes that the announcer had left there. I remembered saying \"thank you\" into the microphone, and wishing I could think of something else to say. Seattle\\'s premier professional theater, The Fifth Avenue, and I was performing on its stage. I had never experienced a night that felt so much like it was going to burst. So full of\\xa0. Yet even as the evening\\'s events recycled through my mind, I felt something prick at my consciousness. I had to know, what did it all mean?There is something warm about applause. About an award. It says that you\\'re appreciated, that you did your job. It is the naked patter of rain or the damp roar of a waterfall, and it sneaks up your spine and tickles the back of your neck. Yet as the evening moved on, each hour felt saturated with it. Brian the Actor. Brian the Actor. Brian the Actor. A strange contradiction began to swim in my stomach. On the one hand, the smiles and cheers. On the other, something deeper. Something inescapable. Beyond the lights and laud, there is a satisfaction in theater that resonates with my core. Something intense.Theater is fundamentally human, and sublimely ancient. It is the seed of religion itself; it is deeply spiritual. A heightened state of mind. You are at once yourself, and someone entirely unlike yourself. You forge a vibrant connection with the audience in a tacit and beautiful chemistry that cannot be grasped, but is always felt.Theater is a process, not an event. For the actor as an individual, it\\'s an internal struggle: finding the meaning as it exists between the character and yourself. Then, as it exists between your performance and those who are watching you perform. It\\'s entering into a focus and dimension that is like space or infinity-that ineffable high that has a meaning of its own. It\\'s sucking the marrow out of each word so that it becomes your own, imbued with life and meaning. It\\'s the research, the internalization, and the assumption of another being. It\\'s finding authenticity in a reality that\\'s made up.A performance lasts a night, and lingers only in mind and memory, but the achievement of theater is permanent. Transformative. It\\'s searching a new depth with every role in order to attain a greater height. It\\'s finding something in yourself that can only be discovered by being someone else.This is theater. And the byproduct of this personal achievement is extraordinary: to be on a stage, and to captivate. To go deep, and perplex reality with what is unfolding under the stage lights. To eradicate the world as it exists outside the four walls of a darkened room.Then there\\'s the byproduct of applause. Brian the Actor. Brian the sixty-year-old pickpocket. And now, standing amidst the molted remains of that knavish old man, Brian the seventeen-year-old high school kid. Brian, standing in his boxers in front of his bathroom mirror after a very long night, with school in the morning.',\n",

It was like we were driving through the streets of a toy city, a miniature suburb built for the amusement of a god-sized obsessive compulsive. I myself was steering the matchbox car, a massive and ancient gray truck I borrowed from my dad, and my girlfriend Alexis occupied the passenger\\'s seat. Clone after architectural clone, we watched the houses float by the truck\\'s windows. We were headed to our very first Listening Party.I really didn\\'t know what to expect. My \"brother\" Keith is actually my half-brother--Dad\\'s first marriage--and quite a bit older than I. He\\'s very intelligent and congenial, albeit occasionally unpredictable, and good looking for someone in his late thirties. He\\'s just the sort of older sibling to suggest a vague \"listening party\" in the middle of the school week and actually inspire me to come. Plus, his friend Astrid was going to be there. She\\'s \"hip.\" I\\'m not certain what that means, but if someone were \"hip,\" it would be Astrid. (She and Keith met in a health food store-he sells aged garlic extract and she\\'s going to be a naturopathic doctor-and they\\'ve been good friends ever since.) Tall and unconventionally beautiful, she made a vivid impression on Alexis and me the first time we all met. We both looked forward to a rendezvous with her and Keith again.We\\'re an unlikely group of friends, I\\'ll admit. Alexis, a freshman at the University of Washington, is...well, how does one describe Alexis? Long, reddish brown hair and a clever smile. Musical prodigy and a black belt in Tae Kwon Do. A girl of her own style. As for me, I\\'m an academic type still in his senior year of high school who has a knack for theater but hates being labeled an actor. I can balance a picnic table bench on my chin. I\\'m composedly quirky.You\\'ve met Keith and Astrid.As a group, we span twenty years from oldest to youngest and yet we connect on a level of common understanding. We click.So that brings us back to the listening party. Let me set the stage:His living room is clean, comfortable, and open, with windows on two sides overlooking the neighborhood. There\\'s a gas fireplace and an elegant coffee table. Not opulent, but nice. After we had all taken up a station on the couch or one of the armchairs, Keith dimmed the lights. The mood was set with the mysterious glow of a few candles; the atmosphere was decidedly rich. The final step was adding the music.Turn by turn, we filled the evening with melody, with rhythm. With chords and memories. Now and then, one of us would dispatch a story: \"the first time I heard this song...\" Or we\\'d talk about the way the music made us feel, why it was effective. The mood in the air became warm, reminiscent, thick, electric, inspired, deep, deeper, and intricate. We shared ourselves through our appreciation of good music. Time flew.And as the evening finally drew to a close, (\"We have to get going-school tomorrow\") I knew it had been time well spent. Time away from work and obligations. Time with good friends, good music, good conversation, and a feeling like something glowing in the atmosphere. We drove back down the street, now befallen with night, and headed home.',\n",

       "  'content': 'Leaping over crooked crevices in the sidewalk, my childhood self hopped a few yards ahead of my grandfather. As I paused to scrutinize a colorful candy wrapper, the smell of melting sugar drifted from a small blue cart where an old woman flipped flat buns on a pan. Grandpa always bought two buns: one for him and one for me.Not long before my fourteenth birthday, my grandfather was diagnosed with a severe case of Alzheimer’s, and shortly afterwards, he moved into a nursing home. Upon entering his room, I shouted “Hi Grandpa!”Grandpa murmured, “Who are you?”The next day, I bought two of the sweet buns Grandpa and I had enjoyed.“Grandpa, do you want one of these?”He paused, then said, “No. Who are you?”Leaving the buns in the paper bag, I replied, “I’m Rachael, your granddaughter.”Eyes widening, he gasped, “You have to get out of here; the communists are guarding this place!”I explained, “No, the Korean War is over! You’re safe in America.” With a small sigh, I returned home for the day.Now, after more than three years, Grandpa recognizes me when I step into his room. However, he cannot connect the round-faced child beside the bun cart to the person I am today. Once a memory slides past the grip of his mind, it can never return.This troubling truth has motivated me to preserve the memories of others in my grandfather’s generation through the War Stories Project. A year after joining the volunteer effort, I have become the coordinator of the project. Fellow volunteers and I collect the experiences of World War II witnesses and collaborate with local colleges to produce a documentary and companion anthology for high school students.While managing the project, I interviewed Holocaust survivor Bruno Bienenfeld, who unraveled the touching story of his childhood. In 1943, his family was taken to the Jasenovic concentration camp, where they were only given one piece of bread a day. But one day, he reached under his threadbare pillow and found another piece of bread. His mother said that it was an answer to his prayers. The young Bruno asked, “Are there Jewish angels?” His mother smiled and said, “There are angels for all people on earth.” Every day, Bruno found an extra bit of bread under his pillow, but after three hard months, his mother died, and the deliveries ceased. He told his father “The angel didn’t put the bread under the pillow tonight.” His father replied, “He was too busy taking Mom to heaven.”Working with primary sources like Mr. Bienenfeld, I learn about World War II from the people who lived it. I also delegate tasks and teach volunteers how to search for and sort images to be used in the documentary. In addition to the responsibilities of coordinator, I have taken on the position of Fundraising Head for the project. Besides speaking publicly on behalf of the War Stories Project in fundraising efforts, I also burn the midnight oil writing letters to more than 200 corporations and local businesses, looking up addresses, and licking envelopes until my mouth goes dry.Each year, more and more World War II veterans and Holocaust survivors pass away, and the loss of these valuable witnesses reminds me of the urgency to preserve their life stories. Just as Grandpa forgot eating sugar-filled buns with me, we can fail to remember what our world has endured. Whether the record of our past must serve as a lesson or reminiscence, we must look back at the path of our history before laying the cobblestones of the future.',\n",

      "As I reflect on my journey thus far, I am reminded of the treasured memories from my childhood. One particular memory stands out vividly - walking with my beloved grandfather, hand in hand, as we eagerly sought out the sweetest buns from a local cart. However, over time, Alzheimer's cruelly began to strip away his memories, including the identity of his once adoring granddaughter. This heartbreaking experience served as a catalyst for my calling: to preserve and protect the memories and stories that define our history.\n",
      "\n",
      "Motivated by a deep-rooted passion to safeguard our shared past, I founded the War Stories Project. This initiative was born out of an urgent need to collect and archive the invaluable narratives of World War II witnesses before they fade away forever. As the dedicated coordinator of this project, I have had the humbling privilege of meeting and interviewing survivors who have personally endured the hardships and sacrifices of that era.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every interaction I have with these precious individuals underscores the importance of remembering. I have witnessed the profound impact that sharing their stories, often for the very first time, has on both the individuals themselves and the broader community. There is a sense of validation, healing, and closure that arises from acknowledging their experiences and recognizing the sacrifices they made for our freedom.\n",
      "\n",
      "Managing the War Stories Project is a responsibility I hold dear to my heart. It is more than just compiling facts and testimonies; it is about creating a safe space for individuals to open up and entrust me with their most precious memories. Each interview is an opportunity to bridge generations, fostering connection and understanding between the past and the present.\n",
      "\n",
      "The urgency of this undertaking cannot be overstated. With each passing day, we lose more World War II witnesses, and along with them, a wealth of knowledge, wisdom, and firsthand accounts. The safeguarding of their memories is not just a tribute to those who have served; it is an acknowledgement of the invaluable lessons we can learn from history. By preserving these stories, I hope to inspire future generations to appreciate the significance of empathy, heroism, and sacrifice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Through my involvement in the War Stories Project, I have come to understand that the act of preserving memories goes beyond archiving the past. It is about shaping our future. The stories of resilience and courage exhibited by these survivors serve as a constant reminder of our shared humanity and the importance of standing up for what is right - regardless of the challenges we face.\n",
      "\n",
      "My experiences have illuminated my path, proving to me that our histories deserve to be cherished and protected. My commitment to safeguarding these memories remains steadfast, and I am excited to continue expanding the reach and impact of the War Stories Project. I aspire to create a lasting legacy of empathy, understanding, and compassion that will reverberate through generations to come.\n",
      "\n",
      "As I embark on my academic journey, I yearn to immerse myself in a program that values the preservation of history and nurtures my desire to make a meaningful impact on society. I believe that by harnessing the power of storytelling, we can forge stronger connections and build a brighter future. With each interview I conduct, I am reminded of the transformative power of empathy and the capacity we all possess to make a difference.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am ready and eager to embrace the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead. By joining this study program, I hope to hone my skills, deepen my understanding, and cultivate lasting connections with like-minded individuals who share my passion for preserving and protecting our collective memories.\n",
      "\n",
      "Safeguarding our history is not just an endeavor; it is a calling that resonates deeply within me. I am ready to take the next step on this remarkable journey, armed with the determination, empathy, and unwavering commitment necessary to make a lasting impact. Together, let us unite in telling the stories that shape our world.\n",
